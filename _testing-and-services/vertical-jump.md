Vertical jump height has been shown to correlate with maximal strength and sprint performance.

The test involves using the Vertec device which measures the displacement between the standing height and vertical jump height.  

The test is a suitable assessment tool for athletes whose sports requires power translated from vertical jump or for the athlete to jump high.
